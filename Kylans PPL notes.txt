The lighter the aircraft, the lower the VA because the control surfaces and wings are subjected to greater stress if maximum control surface inputs are made. The heavier the aircraft, the less effective the control surfaces and wings are at changing the direction of the aircraft due to increased mass.&nbsp;	gleimPPL gleimPPLch2

Explain maneuvering speed in detail 	Maneuvering speed, or Va, is the maximum airspeed at which, at a given weight, one full deflection of one of the primary flight controls will not cause permanent structural damage. As weight goes up, so does Va. This is because a heavier airplane must have a higher AOA to produce sufficient lift. At higher weights, the wing is closer to the critical AOA, meaning the wing will stall before structural damage occurs. At lighter weights, the AOA is lower, meaning there is far more available lift until reaching the wings critical AOA.
