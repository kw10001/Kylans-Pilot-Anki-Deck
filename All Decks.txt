"AVOeK068#u"	Basic+	Private Pilot - General	How does engine torgue contribute to the left-turning tendency of propellor-driven airplanes?	The clockwise direction of the propellor's spinnning creates an equal and opposite force on the fuselage of the airplane causing the airplane to rotate counter-clockwise about it's longitudinal axis.	
b(eVV3k2Sc	Basic+	Private Pilot - General	How does gyroscopic precession contribute to the left-turning tendency of propellor-driven airplanes?	When a force is applied to the rim of a rotating disc, it's resultant force is 90 degrees in the direction of rotation ahead of where the force was applied. This causes a left-turning tendency when the aircraft changes pitch and the force is applied to the propellor disc.&nbsp;	
O%0S{h}KT+	Basic+	Private Pilot - General	How does P-factor contribute to the left-turning tendency of propellor-driven airplanes?	When an airplane is at a high angle of attack, the descending blade of the propellor has a greater angle of attack than the ascending and this creates asymmetrical thrust across the propellor disc.	checkride us

dZ(b$y5t1|	Basic+	Private Pilot - General	What is wing dihedral?	Wing dihedral is the upward angle of the airplane's wing with respect to the horizontal. When the airplane enters an uncoordinated roll during gusty wind conditions, one wing will be elevated and the opposite will drop. This causes an immediate sideslip downward toward the low wing. Since the relative wind is now coming from the side, the low wing experiences a higher angle of attack than the high wing. This difference in angle of attack, leads to more lift from the low wing which rolls the aircraft back to level flight.	general us

c$L0[nqnZ-	Basic-b6ae1	Kylans PPL deck	Describe the alternate static source feature of the aircraft? What is it? Where is it located? What are the considerations for its use?	Alternate static source is a way of bypassing the exterior static source and using one which is located inside the aircraft. The cabin window and cabin vents must be closed and the cabin heater and defroster must be on! The altimeter will show a slightly higher altitude, but this error is less than 50ft unless otherwise placarded. ASI will indicate an airspeed greater than actual.&nbsp;	PA28_POH
e/*e*f@3/&	Basic-b6ae1	Kylans PPL deck	Where are the pitot/static ports on the aircraft? (Archer III)	They are all located on the pitot head (or pitot static mast) under the left wing.
