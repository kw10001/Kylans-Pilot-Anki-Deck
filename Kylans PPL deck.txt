A full scale negative deflection of the ammeter shows what?	Probable failure of the alternator.&nbsp;	PA28_POH

The altimeter will show a slightly higher altitude, but this error is less than 50ft unless otherwise placarded. ASI will indicate an airspeed greater than actual.&nbsp;	PA28_POH
Where are the pitot/static ports on the aircraft? (Archer III)	They are all located on the pitot head (or pitot static mast) under the left wing. This head contains both the inlet for ram air at the front and two holes on the bottom and side for statis pressure reading.&nbsp;	PA28_POH

Describe torque in general terms and how it affects aircraft. 	Torque is the twisting force about an axis. As the prop spins clockwise (from pilot perspective), the airplane experiences a rotating force in the opposite direction. The airplane wants to roll left. The wings help dampen this force. Torque increases with an increase in power. 	PHAK
Describe the siraling slipstream	When the propeller rotates, it creates a spiraling current of air that travels down and around the fuselage. This air eventually reaches the left side of the rudder causing a yaw to the left. The force becomes stronger the more power is applied. 	PHAK
Describe an airfoil 	An airfoil is a streamlined body which is capable of creating significantly more lift than drag.	PHAK
Describe P factor 	P factor is an effect, most pronounced at higher nose attitudes and power settings, where the downward propeller is producing more thrust than the upward propeller. This is because the downward propeller blade has a higher angle of attack than the upward propeller blade when the nose is raised. 	PHAK
Describe gyroscopic precession 	Gyroscopic precession is a force experienced by a rapidly rotating propeller which acts as a sort of gyroscopically stabilized disk when spun. When a single-engined airplane turns to the left, the nose tends to dip; when the turn is to the right, the gyroscopic effect tends to raise the nose. Conventional airplanes experience this force more than tricycle airplanes.	PHAK
What kind of drag is produced when an aircraft is producing lift?	Induced drag. The more lift, the more induced drag.	Aerodynamics
This type of drag is unrelated to lift and can come in the form of skin friction drag, form drag, or interference drag.	Parasite drag	Aerodynamics
This kind of drag is a type of parasite drag caused by rough spots on the skin of the plane. Anything that takes away from a clean, smooth, perfectly aerodynamic surface causes skin friction drag.	Skin friction drag	Aerodynamics
A buildup of ice, frost or snow on the wings causes what kind of drag about the wing surface?	Skin friction drag	Aerodynamics
This type of drag is a type of parasite drag caused simply by the overall shape of the plane and how that shape interacts with the airflow. Some shapes are more aerodynamic than others, and the more cleanly the plane slices through the air, the less drag it will create.	Form drag	Aerodynamics
{{c1::Interference}} drag is a type of parasite drag which is caused by the interaction between the airflow about the airplane and how that airflow interacts with wing struts, gear struts, flight surface affixment points etc. The total amount of drag generated is greater than it would be individually. Interference drag is greatest in areas with sharp angles like where the wing strut meets the fuselage or the underside of the wing as well as where the wings themselves attach to the fuselage.		Aerodynamics
