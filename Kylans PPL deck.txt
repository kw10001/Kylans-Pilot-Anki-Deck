Explain the instruments which are run off the vacuum system. What drives this system?	The attitude indicator and the directional gyro. The vacuum pump is engine driven.&nbsp;
The archer is a ___ volt system&nbsp;	28
The battery is ___ volts and used for starting and backing up alternator output.&nbsp;	24
Electrical power is supplied by a ___ amp alternator	70
What are the standard electrical accessories included with the Archer?	Starter, fuel pump (elec), engine primer, stall warning horn, ammeter, and the annunciator panel
With the engine running, the digital ammeter displays what?&nbsp;	The load placed on the alternator&nbsp;
With all electrical equipment off (except the battery master switch) the ammeter will display what?	The amount of charging current demanded by the battery&nbsp;
Explain the difference between a loadmeter and an ammeter.	A loadmeter instrument displays a 0 to 60 scale which indicates the load placed on the generating capacity of the electrical system by the electrical accessories and battery. An ammeter is used to show the electrical generating performance of the alternator/generator system of the aircraft.&nbsp;
The aircraft is powered off, with only the master switch turned on. What should the loadmeter display?	With all electrial components turned off, the loadmeter reflects only the amount of charging current demanded by the battery.
If an ammeter shows a positive number, what does that indicate?&nbsp;	It shows the charging rate of the battery
A full scale positive deflection of the ammeter shows what?	Probable malfunction of the voltage regulator
A full scale negative deflection of the ammeter shows what?	Probable failure of the alternator.&nbsp;
In normal operations, an ammeter should indicate what on its display?	A zero indication&nbsp;
Your ammeter shows a negative value while in flight, what does this mean?	Your battery is discharging!
What type of vacuum pump is on the airplane?	The airplane has an engine driven, dry type vacuum pump. This dry type pump eliminates the need for an air/oil seperator&nbsp;
You notice a lower than usual vacuum indication, what could this mean?	may indicate a dirty filter, dirty screens, possibly a sticking vacuum regulator or leak in system
Zero vacuum pressure could indicate what?	sheared pump drive, defective pump, collapsed line or defective gauge.&nbsp;
Normal vacuum suction should be what in inches of mercury (inHg)?	4.8 to 5.2 inHg
Higher than normal vacuum suction could do what to your vacuum instruments? How about lower than normal suction?	Higher suction could cause damage to vacuum instruments. Lower than normal suction would make vacuum instruments unreliable.&nbsp;
The turn indicator is what kind of powered instrument? (Archer III)	Electrical
What instruments rely on the pitot tube?	Airspeed indicator
What are the static instruments?	Airspeed indicator, vertical speed indicator, altimeter&nbsp;
Describe the alternate static source feature of the aircraft? What is it? Where is it located? What are the considerations for its use?	Alternate static source is a way of bypassing the exterior static source and using one which is located inside the aircraft. The cabin window and cabin vents must be closed and the cabin heater and defroster must be on! The altimeter will show a slightly higher altitude, but this error is less than 50ft unless otherwise placarded. ASI will indicate an airspeed greater than actual.&nbsp;
Where are the pitot/static ports on the aircraft? (Archer III)	They are all located on the pitot head (or pitot static mast) under the left wing. This head contains both the inlet for ram air at the front and two holes on the bottom and side for statis pressure reading.&nbsp;
Describe the comm antenna(s) on the aircraft and where they are.&nbsp;	Comm antennas are usually located on the top (comm 2) and/or bottom (comm 1) of the fuselage. They are usually long and skinny and, in the case of a bottom mounted antenna, will be bent to ensure adequate clearance from objects on the ground.&nbsp;
Describe the VOR antennas on the aircraft.&nbsp;	They are located on the vertical stabalizer in a horizontal V formation and provide VOR tracking.&nbsp;
Describe the transponder antenna.&nbsp;	Types vary widly but can be a small, several inch long antenna rod sticking out from below the aircraft or a shark fin type antenna.&nbsp;
Describe the shape and location of GPS receivers.	Almost always low profile, flush mount devices located at the top of the fuselage allowing for the best possible exposure to the sky.&nbsp;
In the case of the Archer III, what kind of alternate vacuum pump is provided and where is the switch located?	"An electrical aux vacuum pump is provided in case the engine driven pump fails or becomes unreliable. The aux vac button is located on the left side of the panel and shows ""VAC OFF"" and ""AUX ON"""
What is the purpose of having seperate alternator and battery switches?	In some cases, you may wany to exclude power being provided from an alternator with a faulty voltage regulator to prevent damage to avionics. Conversely, with a fauly battery experiencing thermal runaway, you may want to cut it off from the electrical system.
Explain the Archer II and Archer III electrical volts and amps respectively. What voltage is the battery?	Archer II is a 14 volt, 60 amp system. The Archer III is a 28 volt, 70 amp system. The battery is 24 volt.&nbsp;

Max capacity of the baggage area is ___ (Archer)	200 lbs
Usable fuel capacity at the bottom of the tabs is (Archer)	17 gallons per side
